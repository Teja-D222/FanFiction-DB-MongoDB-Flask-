# FanFiction-DB-MongoDB-Flask-
A functional, end-to-end fan-fiction platform built with MongoDB and Flask

## App Title: The Bulls Fiction Factory
A Flask + MongoDB Fan-Fiction Platform

## Overview
The Bulls Fiction Factory is a lightweight, full-stack web application that allows users to create, view, search, and manage fan fiction stories based on movies. Built using Flask, MongoDB, and a clean HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, the platform demonstrates practical implementation of NoSQL databases, routing, CRUD operations, and UI-driven data submission.
This system is ideal for showcasing practical skills in advanced database management, NoSQL modeling, and web application development.
## Tech Stack
MongoDB – NoSQL database for storing movies, users, and stories
Flask (Python) – Backend routing and application logic
HTML/CSS/JavaScript – Interactive, user-friendly frontend
Homebrew – Package manager used for local setup on macOS/Linux
PyMongo – MongoDB client for Python
## Database Schema
MongoDB stores data using flexible, JSON-like documents. The project uses the following collections (page 3–4):
Database: bull_fitting
Collections:
user — stores username and autogenerated _id
movie — stores movie titles and autogenerated _id
story — stores username, movie, story text, and timestamps
Each collection is illustrated in the screenshots on page 4–5, showing actual JSON documents and retrieval output.

## Application Architecture
The app follows a simple, clean request-flow:
User submits a story via the HTML form
Data is routed to Flask (page 6)
Flask processes and stores the data into MongoDB
The updated content is retrieved and displayed on the homepage
Users can also search or delete entries as needed (pages 9–11)
A diagram summarizing this flow is provided on page 6, showing how MongoDB, Flask, and HTML interact.
## Core Features (CRUD Operations)
➕ Create
Users submit a fan-fiction story with:
Name
Movie title
Story content
Flask inserts each submission into three separate collections (user, movie, story).
Insert logic is shown on page 8.
🔍 Search
Users can search stories by movie title using a case-insensitive regex query.
Search results are dynamically rendered using Jinja templates (page 9–10).
👁️ View
A “View All” feature displays all stories in reverse chronological order (most recent first).
Implemented in Flask route /refresh (page 11).
❌ Delete
Admin can delete multiple selected stories.
Only story entries are removed—user and movie entries are preserved for consistency (page 11–12).
## Why MongoDB?
MongoDB was chosen because it fits the project’s needs for:
✔ Flexible, schema-less document storage
Great for variable story formats and user-generated content.
✔ High scalability
Supports sharding and replica sets for growth.
✔ Fast read/write performance
Ideal for interactive content-submission platforms.
✔ Rich query support
Including text search, regex filtering, aggregation, and indexing.
## Limitations
Local server limits scalability
Free MongoDB tier limited to 500MB
Limited accessibility—app runs only on local machine
Requires manual maintenance and security updates
Performance bottlenecks expected as user traffic grows
## Future Enhancements
User accounts & login system
Integration with OMDB API for automatic movie info retrieval
Ratings, reviews, and comments to enhance community interaction
Cloud hosting (AWS, GCP) for scalability & global access
Upgrade to premium MongoDB tier for more storage + better performance
